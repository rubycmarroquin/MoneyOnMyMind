You could do this by making regular payments, paying off debt, and preventing borrowings that exceed your repayment capabilities. Additionally, it is important to be aware of your credit utilization rate; your total balances should not exceed 30% of your available credit. If you take the steps to improve your credit, you could try to apply for a loan again at a later time.",
